# MR Le Gourmand - Restaurant Website

Welcome to the MR Le Gourmand restaurant website project! Its my first time creating a web app .This project is a simple web application built with Flask, a Python web framework. It showcases the restaurant's menu, allows users to add items to their cart, and provides a contact form for users to submit messages.

## Features

- **Homepage:** Introduces users to the restaurant and provides navigation links to other sections.
- **About Us:** Offers information about the restaurant and its background.
- **Menu:** Displays the restaurant's menu with various items and their prices.
- **Panier (Cart):** Allows users to add items to their cart, view the cart, and proceed with checkout.
- **Contact Us:** Provides a contact form for users to submit messages to the restaurant.
